<h1>About</h1>
<p>Pizzafy is a new app that revolutionizes group pizza ordering. If you've ever thrown a pizza party, you know that figuring out how many pizzas to order for your group is a challenge. Who's a vegetarian? Who's gluten free? It's tough to keep track of everyone's preferences and make sure your guests are well fed.</p>

<p>Pizzafy solves this problem. Your guests enter in their pizza preferences once, and the app recommends exactly the right amount of pizza to serve at your party. Even better, Pizzafy uses a sophisticated algorithm to determine what toppings will make your guests happy.</p>

<p>Pizzafy was developed on a bus. Its team met as part of the 2015 Startup Bus hackathon and they created the app en route from NYC to Nashville. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:talk@pizzafy.me">talk@pizzafy.me</a>.</p>
